# malaria_hainan

The approach expands on previous research to simulate the effect of malaria intervention measures in Hainan by integrating distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) (Gasparrini et al., 2013) with space-time Bayesian hierarchical models (Lowe et al., 2014, Lowe et al., 2018), which were adjusted using integrated nested Laplace approximations in R (R-INLA) (Lindgren et al., 2015). The modelling approach simultaneously describes space-varying, non-linear, and delayed associations between parasites positivity and environmental/intervention variables. These associations between exposure, lag and response can elucidate the potential impact of intervention strategies on the risks of P. falciparum or P. vivax infections during the implementation phase.
